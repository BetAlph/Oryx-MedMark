<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Why did I start this project?
* I'd been hospitalized for overdosing on some medication I'd been wrongly prescribed twice.
* The current medical system is plagued by bureaucratic processes, long wait times, and unsatisfactory service.
* I decided something had to be done about it.

### What do I plan to do with it in the future?
* In the future, I plan to work on AI to automate repetitive tasks and protocols so healthcare workers can focus on connecting with patients on a deeper level.
* In particular, I'll build AI LLMs (large language models) based on patients' inquiries, to streamline the process of registering at the reception in a hospital.
